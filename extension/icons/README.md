# Icon Placeholder

The extension requires icon files in the `icons/` directory.

## Required Icons:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## How to Create Icons:

### Option 1: Use Online Generator
1. Visit https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
2. Create a simple icon with:
   - Text: "FND" or "🔍"
   - Background: Purple gradient (#667eea)
   - Foreground: White
3. Download and place files here

### Option 2: Use Canva
1. Go to https://www.canva.com
2. Create custom sizes: 16x16, 48x48, 128x128
3. Design with purple theme
4. Export as PNG

### Option 3: Quick Placeholder
For testing, you can use any PNG images renamed to:
- icon16.png
- icon48.png
- icon128.png

## Temporary Solution:
Copy any small PNG image three times and rename them to the required sizes.
The extension will work with placeholder icons for development.
