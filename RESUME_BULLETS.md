# Resume Bullets - Fake News Detection System
**Project by Mohammed Nehal**

---

## ATS-Optimized Resume Bullets

### Option 1 (Technical Focus - Full-Stack AI)
**Engineered production-grade fake news detection system leveraging ML classification (98.2% accuracy), multi-source verification engine, and RAG-powered evidence retrieval**, deploying FastAPI backend with 11 REST endpoints, FAISS vector store, HuggingFace transformers, and Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) for real-time browser-based verification with sub-2-second inference across 6+ trusted news sources

### Option 2 (Impact Focus - Scalability)
**Architected and deployed containerized AI verification platform processing real-time misinformation detection via Logistic Regression ML pipeline (10K training samples), asynchronous multi-source scraping (Reuters, AP, BBC, The Hindu), and sentence-transformer embeddings**, achieving 98.2% classification accuracy with Docker-based microservices architecture integrating Redis caching and persistent FAISS vector database

### Option 3 (Comprehensive - End-to-End)
**Developed end-to-end fake news detection system combining TF-IDF ML classification, intelligent claim extraction, RAG evidence retrieval (FAISS + SentenceTransformers), and abstractive summarization (DistilBART)**, delivering browser extension with 4-tier color-coded verification, 8 specialized AI assistant endpoints, and full Docker containerization for cloud deployment on Render/Railway platforms

## Breakdown by Technical Skills

### Machine Learning & NLP
- Trained Logistic Regression classifier on 10,000+ articles achieving 98.2% accuracy using TF-IDF vectorization and sklearn pipeline
- Implemented claim extraction algorithm with entity recognition and priority ranking for verifiable statements
- Deployed HuggingFace DistilBART transformer for abstractive summarization with TF-IDF fallback mechanism

### Backend Development
- Built FastAPI RESTful API with 11 endpoints including 8 specialized AI assistant routes for Q&A, evidence retrieval, and draft generation
- Engineered asynchronous multi-source verification system scraping 6+ news outlets (Reuters, AP, BBC) with BeautifulSoup4 and aiohttp
- Integrated FAISS vector store with 384-dimensional SentenceTransformer embeddings for semantic similarity search

### DevOps & Deployment
- Containerized application using Docker multi-stage builds with Python 3.10-slim base and health checks
- Orchestrated microservices with Docker Compose managing FastAPI backend and Redis cache with volume persistence
- Configured CI/CD pipeline for deployment to Render/Railway with environment-based configuration management

### Frontend & Browser Extension
- Developed Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) with service worker, content scripts, and real-time API integration
- Implemented color-coded UI (green/red/yellow/purple) displaying verification status, confidence scores, and source breakdown
- Created responsive popup interface with full-page and selection-based analysis modes
